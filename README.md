# attention-u-net-medical-image-segmentation

Attention U-Net is a variant of the U-Net architecture for medical image segmentation. It integrates attention gates (AGs) to focus on relevant image regions, suppressing irrelevant background. This improves feature learning and localization, particularly for small or complex structures, enhancing segmentation accuracy in tasks like organ or tumor detection.
